# Invinity - E-Invoicing Appliation

## Introduction

Invinity is a robust invoicing web application  designed to streamline financial workflows for freelancers and small businesses. By bridging the gap between complex accounting software and manual spreadsheets, Invinity offers a user-centric platform to manage the entire billing lifecycle.

## Technology stack
Invinity was developed using VS Code for streamlined coding and GitHub for secure, version-controlled repository management. During the engineering of the back-end, Postman was essential for debugging and testing RESTful API endpoints, ensuring seamless data flow between the client and server.

Based on the three-layer architecture chosen for the invoice application, the stack used is MERN,  pre-built technology stack based on JavaScript technologies. This stack was chosen because it makes the deployment of full-stack web applications easier and faster.

### Presentation Layer(Front-end)
Developed using React and Vite, focusing on a highly responsive UI/UX. Styling is handled via Tailwind CSS, featuring a custom purple-themed aesthetic designed for clarity and professional appeal.
### Application Layer(Back-end)
Powered by Node.js and Express.js, this layer manages the core business logic, including JWT-based authentication, server-side PDF generation, financial calculations and graphs.
### Data Layer(Database)
Utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose to provide a flexible, schema-based NoSQL storage solution for managing complex entity relationships (Clients, Vendors, Invoices and Reports).
